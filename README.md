# Big-Data
Code and results from projects in Big Data

Poject 1:
Investigating the impact of different classification algorithms when subjected to mislabeling in the training data. 
The classifiers were: k-Nearest Neighbours and Linear Regression.
  Code and Pdf


Project 2:
Investigating the impact of linkage on hierachal clustering and covariance type on Gaussian Mixture Model clustering.
  Code and Pdf

Project 3:
Sparse vs Dense classification.
Comparing two model pairs consisting of model for dense data and modified model for sparse data.
  Code and Pdf

Project 4:
Kernel k-means. Basically mapping the data through a kernel to another space before clustering. Comparing different kernels.
  Code and Pdf

Final project:
Big dataset containing two labels, far too many features and different amounts of data points for the two classes. 
Trying to find the most important features used to best classify the data using sparse classification and pre-processing.
